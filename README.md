## ✨ Introduction

Jarvis Assistant is a **desktop voice assistant** built in Python, inspired by Iron Man’s AI.  
It listens to your voice, understands commands, and performs tasks like searching the web, opening applications, and even sending emails.  
With extensible Python modules, you can teach Jarvis new tricks anytime.
